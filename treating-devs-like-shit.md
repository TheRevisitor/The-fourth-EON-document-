# Ever wondered why most of the old eon devs/modders left?

just take a look at this.


# BENGIO_10
Here's Rio treating bengio10 (custom weapon modder) like shit

He swears that the servers crash due to the custom weapons and humiliates bengio infront of the whole server even though it was an issue on his end.

let's not mention that he has done this in the past.

Rio barely even pays the guy, without him the project would most likely be dead.

ALSO another interesting thing, 
Rio tried replacing bengio with murilo on november 24 2024 because "he was lazy and provided minimum support on the paks and didn't even work good" 


# MURILOGAMING19
wow, the modders love being pushed to work even if they can't.

Murilo spent time making custom weapons for eon but rio decided not to use them at all.
